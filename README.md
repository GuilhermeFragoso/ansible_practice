# ANSIBLE PRACTICE


# Infrastructure as Code

## Goal

The objective of this repository is to show what i learned about Vagrant and Ansible and how i used those technologies to create two virtual machines, one responsible to run Wordpress (I don't know absolute nothing about Wordpress) and another to run MySQL (Currently studying SQL)


## In short I used:

- Vagrant ( to create, config and run the VMs)
- Ansible ( to configure and install everything needed for the VMs)

### Props to Alura (www.alura.com.br) where i watched this course
